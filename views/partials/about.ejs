      <p>
        At Spoonful: Stories, we believe that recipes are more than a list of
        ingredients—they’re stories of culture, heritage, and creativity shared
        from one kitchen to another. Our mission is to provide a welcoming space
        for cooks of all backgrounds to connect, inspire, and explore the
        world’s flavors together. Here, every recipe holds a personal story, and
        every story adds a new flavor to the community. Join us in celebrating
        the diversity of home-cooked meals and passing down traditions, one
        spoonful at a time.

      <h2 class="about-head">Our Values</h2>
      <p>
        To become a global community where every kitchen is a source of
        inspiration, connection, and discovery. We envision Spoonful: Stories as
        a space where people can explore diverse recipes, share their culinary
        journeys, and celebrate the art of home cooking. By bridging cultures
        through food, we hope to foster a world where each recipe not only
        nourishes but also connects, building a shared understanding across
        generations and borders.
